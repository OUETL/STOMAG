The model will be used to educate patients, age 17 years and under, that are able to learn and perform the necessary skills. The model will also teach parents, caregivers, and staff nurses.

The primary goal for the model is to provide the patient and caregivers a customized practicing opportunity to enhance their new skills and learning experience. The purpose is for the able patients and their caregivers to measure various sized stomas and perform ostomy pouching techniques tailored to the individual's specific presentation and needs. When they pouch, they place an adhesive-backed disc onto the patient's skin around the stoma to contain stool in an attached pouch.

They care for a diverse population that vary in body habitus. One patient can have a stoma that is 6mm in diameter and another that has a stoma of 76mm. There are adult teaching tools available with stomas that measure 1-1/4" and greater. However, there is nothing for neonates and pediatrics. They desire a baby sized abdomen with various sized stomas ranging from 6mm to 25mm that are able to be changed out to individualize their teaching plan.
